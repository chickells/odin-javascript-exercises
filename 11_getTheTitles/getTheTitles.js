// this isn't really making sense tbh but i think
// it's something relatively simple, just a method i haven't learned yet.
// until next time!

// also, with the 25k... (aka 15-17k remainder after CC debt)
// would it be beneficial to use it to pay for bills and instead
// work like 1-2 days a week and do TONS of hw
// AND/OR do a proper bootcamp??

// because in the long run i think that would net me more future gainz...
// fack that's def much higher risk tho
// so either play it safe and put it to student loans,
// pay for bootcamp/bills while i teach myself
// upgrade car (probably least smart option tbh)
// invest
// combo of everything

// WE GOT TIME TO SORT IT OUT
// alright lets do next 3 sessions, im hungry af

// Do not edit below this line
